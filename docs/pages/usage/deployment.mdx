# Deploying your own Sweep instance via Docker

*ðŸŽ‰ We recently changed our license to the Elastic License V2 to allow Sweep for commercial usage.*<br/>You can self-host Sweep by deploying our Docker image at https://ghcr.io/sweepai/sweep.

## 0. Pre-requisites

You need an OpenAI API key, preferably with GPT-4 32k, and [GitHub developer mode](https://github.com/settings/apps).

## 1. Setting up the GitHub App

Register a new GitHub App, following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) with settings:

Permissions:

```
actions: read
check: read
contents: read & write
commit statuses: read & write
issues: read & write
metadata: read
pull requests: read & write
workflows: read & write
```

Webhook events:

```
issues
pull request
workflow run
check run
issue comment
label
pull request review
pull request review comment
pull request thread
status
workflow job
create
commit comment
check suite
push
```

Disable the webhook for now. You can use any URL for the homepage (e.g. repository URL). [Install the app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-your-own-github-app) on your account or organization and generate a private key as per [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps).

## 2. Running the Webhook

Now create the following `.env` file with the new secrets:

```sh
# Replace all newlines here with \n
GITHUB_APP_PEM="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----xxxxxxxx...xxxxxxxx-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
# 6 digit ID
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
# The name of your GitHub App
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=github-app-name

# Should start with "sk-"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# Set to true if you have access to 32k model
OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=false
```

Then in the same directory as the `.env`, run

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 -d ghcr.io/sweepai/sweep:latest
```

## 3. Connecting the Webhook to the App

    </a>

From here, do one of the following and grab the publicly accessible webhook URL:
* Use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or a similar reverse proxy tool to redirect `https://127.0.0.1:8000` to something like `https://e5bf90f4a3be.ngrok.app`. This is great for quickly testing locally.
* Deploy the docker image in production on a service like DigitalOcean or Elastic Container Registry. This is great for a permanent deployment.

If your deployment URL is `https://e5bf90f4a3be.ngrok.app`, your webhook URL is `https://e5bf90f4a3be.ngrok.app/webhook`.

With the webhook URL, go back to the GitHub Apps settings (`https://github.com/USERNAME/settings/apps/APP_NAME/advanced`) to populate the webhook URL field with this copied URL. Ensure SSL verification remains active.

*There's additional configurable settings like Redis caching and GPU-accelerated embeddings that we use for our hosted product that we can document further for self-hosting. If this interests you please contact us at https://discord.gg/sweep.*
